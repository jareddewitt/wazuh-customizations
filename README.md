 The repositaory servers as a place for my personal customizations to get the most out of Wazuh that I personally need.

# to-do
 Update the benchmarks for the new CIS benchmars (Version 2.0.0)
    Reference. https://workbench.cisecurity.org/benchmarks?q=Microsoft+Windows
    Currently there is no easy way to parse these out.  CIS doesn't offer a json file with clear audit rules.  This makes it difficult/time consuming to convert them to a yml file readable by Wazuh.
